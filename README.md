## RMIT Software Testing ISYS1085 / ISYS1087

### Week 3 Prac Junit Exercise 1

#### Objectives
These prac exercises are focussed on Junit 5 and are pitched to students with some minimal exposure to unit testing in earlier courses. 
The objective over the two weeks is for students to feel comfortable using Junit 5 commands like:- 
- fail 
- assertEquals
- assertSame 
- assertTrue / assertFalse
- assertThrows Exception classes

Other  objectives include using Junit / Eclipse IDE to:-
- write test cases before implementing them 
- and perhaps some simple timing related functions  

#### Preparation

Get ready with a recent/latest version of Eclipse and java compiler version 1.6+ Eclipse will let you add Junit 5 to the library or use maven dependencies.

#### Tasks

* First get set up so you can run the Example 1 code. The MyCalculator class implements the Calculator interface
* Review the commented out test functions to get you started.
* Start writing test cases using those suggested test function names, or rename as required.
* Is one test case enough to test each method? Consider why you might need to have more than one test case to check a variety of different inputs or conditions.
* Consider where you might assertTrue and also assertFalse
* Consider where you expect a null or not-null return or condition.
* Consider what Exceptions might be thrown by one or more of the calculator functions, and write a test method to check for that.
